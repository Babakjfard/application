# AccepT&C
The github repository I created as my initial project at [INSIGHT](https://www.insightdatascience.com/). From ideation to a working Minimum Viable Product (MVP), it is required to take 3 weeks.

## Specifications
* [A web app](http://acceptornot.xyz/) on AWS using python, Flask, jinja2, to categorize sentences of Terms and Conditions (T&C) documents into risky and non-risky, from the perspective of a customerâ€™s rights.

* Built a pipeline to download, parse, and feed JSON files into Pandas dataframes to preprocess texts. Applied TF, Word2vec and Logistic Regression for categorizing sentences.

* More explantions can be found in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16k3SoxMPiSTVO-VDhaCq4AhCDCRE2SbqmKGFGObqmiM/edit#slide=id.p1)
